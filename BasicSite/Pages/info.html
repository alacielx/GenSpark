    <h3>Habits and Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>
        Red-eyed crocodile skinks are semi-fossorial and terrestrial reptiles. They are very secretive and prefer to be on their own except for mothers with their offspring. They are active during the day. Red-eyed crocodile skinks are excellent climbers but they spend most of their time among the leaf litter on the forest floor. When climbing, they will stick to low lying branches and fallen logs and do not venture to the top of tree canopies. They are also very good swimmers. The Red-eyed crocodile skink is one of the few species of skinks that vocalize when in distress. When startled, they tend to freeze and have been known to "play dead" (even when handled).
