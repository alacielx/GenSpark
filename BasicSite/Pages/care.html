        <h2>Caring for One</h2>
    </header>
    <h3>Lighting and Heating</h3>
    <p>
        Lighting is very important for your Skink because UV B radiation encourages the production of vitamin D3 which isomerizes from pre-vitamin D3.
        <br><br>
        Whilst vitamin D3 can be given as a supplement in their diet, your skink should have access to 12 hours of UVB light per day. This can be achieved through natural lighting or by a UVB bulb:
        <br><br>
        As well as UVB lighting, a Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink should also have a heat lamp to create a basking spot. The basking area should be 80℉-82℉.
    </p>
    <h3>Feeding</h3>
    <p>
        A suitable diet for this lizard is small-insects and other invertebrates, such as crickets, silkworms, and red worms. Their diet requires live-prey, which can be found at a local reptile or pet-supplies store:
        <br><br>
        - Adults should be fed about three crickets every 48 hours (sticking to the dusk-dawn feeding routine)
        <br><br>
        - Juveniles will eat two crickets every 24 hours instead
        <br><br>
        While caring for the Red-Eyed Crocodile Skink, owners should dust their food with calcium and Vitamin D3 to supplement their diet. If they do not eat all of their food, it should be removed as you spot-clean the tank.
        <br><br>
        Finally, as with any lizard, they should have access to clean water. A shallow bowl of water would suit them best to stop them from knocking it over.
    </p>
    <h3>Handling</h3>
    <p>
        Red-Eyed Crocodile Skinks are not aggressive. However, they should still be handled infrequently because handling generally frightens these skinks.
        <br><br>
        They are more of for-show reptile, rather than a companion or handling-reptile. Handling may cause them to freeze or to lose their tails.
